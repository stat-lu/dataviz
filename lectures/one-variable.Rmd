## Visualizing a Single Variable

Best place to start: continuous or discrete one-dimensional data.

--

.pull-left[
### Example

The time between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser.

Always start by thinking about what the data represents.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The Old Faithful Geyser (Albert Bierstadt, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons)", out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/old-faithful.jpg")
```
]

---

## Dot Plots

Dot plot is good for small data sets.

```{r, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 8.5, fig.cap = "Duration between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser."}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(faithful, aes(waiting)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1) + #<<
  guides(y = "none") # default guide is incorrect
```

---

## Histograms

Histogram separates data into bins and counts the number of observations.

Choice of bin widths is critical:

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.cap = "Too narrow bin width. (This is actually equivalent to a bar plot.)", fig.height = 3}
faithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(waiting)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.cap = "Reasonable bin width", fig.height = 3}
faithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(waiting)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3) #<<
```
]

---

## Box Plots

.pull-left[
Box plot

- is the most common type:

  - middle bar: **median** (2nd quartile)
  - edges of box: 1st and 3rd **quartiles**
  - whiskers: last observation within 1.5 times the
    inter-quartile range (IQR)
  - points: observations outside 1.5 times the IQR

- is compact,
- but not suitable for data with multiple modes.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.cap = "Box plot of the Old Faithful data, which fails completely in accurately describing the distribution."}
faithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(waiting)) +
    geom_boxplot() #<<
```
]

---

## Density Plots

Density plot 
- is great when you have lots of data and the variable is continuous,
- but it is sensitive to settings (type of kernel, bandwidth)

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.height = 3}
faithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(waiting)) +
    geom_density(bw = 5) #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.height = 3}
faithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(waiting)) +
    geom_density(bw = 10) #<<
```
]

- often good idea to add a **rug** layer (`geom_rug()`) to density plots

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- c(-1, 3, 5, 6, 9)
n <- length(x)

l <- lapply(x, function(xi) {
  a <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 100)
  d <- dnorm(a) / n
  data.frame(
    x = xi,
    a = a + xi,
    d = d
  )
})

res <- do.call(rbind, l)

p1 <- ggplot() +
  xlim(c(-5, 15)) +
  ylim(c(0, 0.15)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Density")

p2 <- p1 +
  geom_rug(aes(x), data = tibble(x = x), cex = 1, col = "navy")

p3 <- p2 + 
  geom_line(aes(a, d, group = x), col = "dark orange", data = res)

p4 <- p3 +
  geom_density(aes(x), bw = 1, data = tibble(x = x))
```

### How Does a Density Plot Work?

We start with an empty canvas.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7}
p1
```

---

### How Does a Density Plot Work?

Then we mark the points with a rug layer (`geom_rug()`).

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7}
p2
```

---

### How Does a Density Plot Work?

Next, we add a Gaussian (Normal) density kernel for each point.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7}
p3
```

---

### How Does a Density Plot Work?

Finally, we sum the kernels together.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7}
p4
```

The black line is our final density estimate.

## Violin Plots

Violin plot is a type of density plot, often as an alternative to box plots when you have lots of (continuous) data.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6.5, fig.cap = "geom_violin() does not work with a single variable, so we use the trick y = 1 here."}
faithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(waiting, y = 1)) +
    geom_violin() #<<
```

---

## Combining Layers

With ggplot, it's easy to combine layers.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6.5, fig.cap = "A combined box and violin plot"}
faithful %>%
  ggplot(aes(waiting, y = 1)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = "slategray2")
```

## Recap

- ![](images/geom_dotplot.png) Few observations? Try a **dot plot**.

- ![](images/geom_density.png) ![](images/geom_violin.png) Lots of data on a continuous variable? 
  **Density**  and **violin** plots are great!

- ![](images/geom_boxplot.png) The data is uni-modal and you only care about quartiles (e.g. the median) and extreme values? 
 The **box plot** will fit the bill nicely.

- ![](images/geom_histogram.png) In most other cases,  a **histogram** is usually
your best best.

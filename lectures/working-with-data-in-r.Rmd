## Data in R

- R has excellent facilities for handling data
- roughly speaking, two approaches
  * base R
  * tidyverse
- in this course we will use the tidyverse approach

--

.pull-left[
### Tidyverse

- a collection of packages built around a set of
  principles and design choices. 
- includes the package **ggplot2** that we will use for all our
  visualizations in this course
  
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyverse-logo.png")
```
]

---

class: middle
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyverse-workflow.svg")
```

---

## An Example

```{r cars-code, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# import
read_csv("data/us_cars.csv") %>%
  # wrangle
  mutate(price = price*8.65) %>%
  # visualize
  ggplot(aes(mileage, y = price, color = title_status)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "mileage (miles)", 
       y = "price (sek)", 
       color = "status") 
```

---

class: center, middle

```{r ref.label = "cars-code", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6}

```


---

## Importing Data

Data can be stored in a myriad of formats (`.csv`, `.tsv`, `.dat`, `.sav`, etc).
  
--

We will use the **readr** package, in which functions are named
`read_*()`. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data_tsv <- read_tsv("data.tsv") 
data_csv <- read_csv("data.csv")
# and so on
```
  
--
  
Always inspect the result; datasets are not always stored in a clean way.

In this course, however, you will generally be provided data that needs little 
preprocessing.
  
--

Many datasets are available from base R or from packages.

--

---

### Using RStudio to Import Data

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("videos/rstudio-data-import.gif")
```

---

## Data Wrangling

Many times, data is not in the format that we need it to be; it needs to be 
**wrangled** with.

Our workhorses: [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
and [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)

--

.pull-left[
### dplyr

used for data manipulation, such as

* creating new variables,
* modifying existing variables,
* filtering, and
* subsetting data.
]

--

.pull-right[
### tidyr

used for reshaping data, such as

* pivoting data,
* merging and separating variables, and
* extracting variables.
]

---

## Data Semantics

```{r echo = FALSE}
d <- tibble(person = rep(c("James", "Julia", "Bixby"), times = 2),
            intervention = rep(c("control", "treatment"), each = 3),
            result = c(1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 3))
```

Most data is made up of a rectangular table of **rows** and **columns**.

The elements (cells) in this table are **values**.

Each value corresponds to an **observation** and a **variable**.

There are usually multiple ways to format the same data:

<br>

--

.pull-left[
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(pivot_wider(d, names_from = "intervention", values_from = "result"),
             caption = "Version A")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(pivot_wider(d, names_from = "person", values_from = "result"),
             caption = "Version B")
```
]

---



## Tidy Data
.pull-left-60[

In tidy data:
* each observation has its own row,
* each variable its own column, and
* each value its own cell.

Tidy data makes visualization easy.

In our example variables are: **person**, **intervention**, and **result**.
]

.pull-right-40[
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(d, caption = "Tidy treament data")
```
]

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-data.png")
```

---

## Reshaping Data with tidyr

In `d`, we've stored the treatment data from before.

```{r echo = FALSE}
d_wide <- pivot_wider(d, names_from = "intervention", values_from = "result")
```


```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse) # loads tidyr, dplyr, tibble, etc
d <- tibble(person = c("James", "Julia", "Bixby"), 
            control = c(1, 3, 2), 
            treatment = c(5, 6, 3))
```

--

To reshape this into **tidy** data, we will use the function
`pivot_longer()` (from **tidyr**).

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
d_tidy <- pivot_longer(
  data = d, 
  cols = c("control", 
           "treatment"), 
  names_to = "intervention",
  values_to = "result"
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE}
d_tidy
```
]

---

## Manipulating Data with dplyr

* `filter()` to filter rows (observations):

```{r, echo = TRUE}
filter(d_tidy, 
       person != "Bixby")
```

---

## Manipulating Data with dplyr

* `select()` to select columns (variables):

```{r, echo = TRUE}
select(d_tidy, person, result)
```

---

## Manipulating Data with dplyr

* `mutate()` to modify or add new variables:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mutate(d_tidy, rel_result = result/max(result))
```

---

## Manipulating Data with dplyr

* `group_by()` and `summarize()` to group and summarize data:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
group_by(d_tidy, intervention) %>%
  summarize(mean_result = mean(result))
```

---

## The Pipe Operator

The `%>%` (pipe) operator is very useful when working with data.

It takes the left-hand (or line above) and forwards it into the next function

```{r, echo = TRUE}
d_tidy %>% 
  filter(person == "James") %>%
  select(intervention, result)
```

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
select(filter(d_tidy, person == "James"), intervention, result)
```

---

## Missing Data

Normally, missing data should be approached with diligence (e.g. imputation), but in 
this course we will usually simply disregard it (`drop_na()`).

Missing data is denoted by `NA` in R.

Functions applied to missing data often return `NA` unless `na.rm = TRUE`
is specified.

```{r echo = FALSE}
msleep %>%
  select(name, sleep_rem, sleep_cycle, brainwt, bodywt) %>%
  head(5) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---

## Learning More

In this course, we will only scrape the surface.

Our scope is limited to **making data ready for visualizations**.

If you want to learn more about data wrangling and tidy data, we recommend
the chapter [Wrangle](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html) in
the free e-book *R for Data Science*.

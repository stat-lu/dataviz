To understand visualizations effectively, it's important to be familiar with the anatomy of a plot. In this text, we will discuss some of the fundamental parts of a plot, acquainting you with the terminology that will be extensively used throughout this course.

To get going, we first need a plot to focus on. We'll use a simple plot of
horsepower versus fuel consumption from the `mtcars` dataset.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy.png")
```

To produce the plot, simply run the following code.

```{r anatomy, fig.cap = "Horsepower and fuel consumption. Each dot represents a motor car from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine.", eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

mtcars %>%
  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Horsepower",
    y = "Fuel Consumption (miles per US gallon)",
    color = "Cylinders"
  )
```

# The Canvas 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-canvas.png")
```

The canvas, also called the plot area, is the area where the data is drawn. Everything outside of the canvas consists of annotations, which usually do not display data directly.

If you use facets in your plot, your visualization might contain several canvases. We'll discuss facets in detail later, but for now, it's sufficient to think of facets as multiple plots arranged in sequence, one after the other.

# Grid

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-grid.png")
```

Sometimes, as in the default ggplot2 theme, the canvas is divided into sections
by a grid. A grid often makes it easier to compare data points, especially when
they are far apart. Grids are particularly useful when there are few 
observations in a visualization.

Grids often have major and minor gridlines, and this plot is no exception, although the difference between them is slight.

# Geoms

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-geoms.png")
```

The geoms in the plot are geometrical shapes that are used to draw data. Here, we
are using points as our geoms.

# Axes

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-axes.png")
```

The axes are guides for the connection between the coordinates of the geoms
and the variables they are mapped to. Without the axes, we would only see the 
pattern of points and not the values these points represent.

On each axis, there are numbers or words, and these are connected to the gridlines through *ticks* or *tickmarks* .

# Legends

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-legend.png")
```

A legend is a guide that helps you interpret an aesthetic element mapped to a variable in the plot. In this plot, the legend associates a color scale with the number of cylinders.

The legend is sometimes also called a *key*.

# Guide Titles

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/anatomy-titles.png")
```

The guide titles describe the variables and often the units for the 
data.
